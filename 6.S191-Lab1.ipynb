All these functions take a list argument that determines their shape. Here we use tf.truncated_normal for our weights, and tf.zeros for our biases. Its important that the shape of these parameters are compatible. We’ll be matrix-multiplying the weights, so the last dimension of the previous weight matrix must equal the first dimension of the next weight matrix. Notice this pattern in the following tensor initialization code. Lastly, notice the size of the tensor for our last weights.

Ideas include: randomizing mini-batches, making the network deeper, using word embeddings (see below) rather than bag-of-words, trying different optimizers (like Adam), different weight initializations. We’ll explore some of these tomorrow.\n",

    "In this lab we used Bag-of-Words to represent a tweet.  Word Embeddings are a more meaningful representation.  The basic idea is we represent a word with a vector $\\phi$ by the context the word appears in. We do this by training a neural network to predict the context of words across a large training set. The weights of that neural network can then be thought of as a dense and useful representation that captures context. This is useful because now our representations of words captures actual semantic similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word Embeddings capture all kinds of useful semantic relationships. For example, one cool emergent property is $ \\phi(king) - \\phi(queen) = \\phi(man) - \\phi(woman)$. To learn more about the magic behind word embeddings we recommend Chris Olah's [blog post](https://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-NLP-RNNs-Representations/). A common tool for generating Word Embeddings is word2vec."
