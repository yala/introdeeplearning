There are a ton of different initial Tensor value functions you can use ([full list](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/constant_op/)). All these functions take a list argument that determines their shape. Here we use tf.truncated_normal for our weights, and tf.zeros for our biases. Its important that the shape of these parameters are compatible. We’ll be matrix-multiplying the weights, so the last dimension of the previous weight matrix must equal the first dimension of the next weight matrix. Notice this pattern in the following tensor initialization code. Lastly, notice the size of the tensor for our last weights. We are predicting a vector of size n_classes so our network needs to end with n_classes nodes."

    "#### Quick Conceptual Note:\n",
    "Nearly everything we do in TensorFlow is an operation with inputs and outputs. Our loss variable is an operation, that takes the output of the last layer of the net, which takes the output of the 2nd-to-last layer of the net, and so on. Our loss can be traced back to the input as a single function. This is our full computation graph. We pass this to our optimizer which is able to compute the gradient for this computation graph and adjust all the weights in it to minimize the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Training our Net\n",
    "We have our network, our loss function, and our optimizer ready, now we just need to pass in the data to train it. We pass in the data in chunks called mini-batches.  We do backpropogation at the end of a batch based on the loss that results from all the examples in the batch.  Using batches is just like Stochastic Gradient Descent, except instead of updating parameters after each example, we update them based on the gradient computed after *several* examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure how well we're doing, we can't just look at how well our model performs on it's training data. It could be just memorizing the training data and perform terribly on data it hasn't seen before. To really measure how it performs in the wild, we need to present it with unseen data, and we can tune our hyper-parameters (like learning rate, num layers etc.) over this first unseen set, which we call our development (or validation) set. However, given that we optimized our hyper-parameters to the development set, to get a true fair assesment of the model, we test it with respect to a held-out test set at the end, and generally report those numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we'll just use a training set and a testing set.  We'll train with the training set and evaluate on the test set to see how well our model performs."

    "Running this code, you’ll see the network train and output its performance as it learns. I was able to get it to 65.5% accuracy. This is just OK, considering random guessing gets you 33.3% accuracy. In the next tutorial, you'll learn some ways to improve upon this.\n",

    "## Concluding Thoughts\n",
    "This was a brief introduction into TensorFlow. There is so, so much more to learn and explore, but hopefully this has given you some base knowledge to expand upon. As an additional exercise, you can see what you can do with this code to improve the performance. Ideas include: randomizing mini-batches, making the network deeper, using word embeddings (see below) rather than bag-of-words, trying different optimizers (like Adam), different weight initializations. We’ll explore some of these tomorrow.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### More on Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we used Bag-of-Words to represent a tweet.  Word Embeddings are a more meaningful representation.  The basic idea is we represent a word with a vector $\\phi$ by the context the word appears in. We do this by training a neural network to predict the context of words across a large training set. The weights of that neural network can then be thought of as a dense and useful representation that captures context. This is useful because now our representations of words captures actual semantic similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word Embeddings capture all kinds of useful semantic relationships. For example, one cool emergent property is $ \\phi(king) - \\phi(queen) = \\phi(man) - \\phi(woman)$. To learn more about the magic behind word embeddings we recommend Chris Olah's [blog post](https://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-NLP-RNNs-Representations/). A common tool for generating Word Embeddings is word2vec."
